/*******************************************************************************
 * Function: tvf_TeacherRosterMath  (INLINE table-valued function)
 * Purpose: @UPN-parameterized roster for the web-app MATH entry grid. Same
 *          three role branches as tvf_TeacherRoster (Teacher / SchoolAdmin+
 *          Specialist / RegionalAnalyst), but returns ONE ROW PER (student x
 *          applicable task): each student is joined to THEIR grade's DimMathTask
 *          set for the cycle's month, with the latest recorded result and the
 *          student's Math-IPP status. A multi-grade homeroom therefore returns
 *          each grade's own task set against its own students. The web app
 *          pivots these rows into the student x task matrix.
 * Created: 2026-09-03
 * Region: Canada East (PIIDPA compliant)
 *
 * Task selection: DimMathTask WHERE GradeCode = student.Grade AND AssessmentMonth
 *   = the cycle's benchmark/dominant month (same month lever reading uses) AND
 *   ActiveFlag = 1. Description is chosen by program: French Immersion -> FR text
 *   (falling back to EN until FR is seeded), else EN.
 *
 * Result: latest-by-date per (student, window, task) — FactAssessmentMath keeps a
 *   dated history (ongoing-assessment model), so the rn=1 pick shows the most
 *   recent 0/1 without fanning a task out to one row per entry.
 *
 * SECURITY: trusts @UPN; SELECT granted to the SP only (see tvf_TeacherRoster
 *   header). Role logic mirrors tvf_TeacherRoster exactly.

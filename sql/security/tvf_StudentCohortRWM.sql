/*******************************************************************************
 * Function: tvf_StudentCohortRWM  (INLINE table-valued function)
 * Purpose: READ-ONLY Reading·Writing·Math achievement roll-up for Reports > RWM
 *          (0.7.0, item 5). One row per in-scope Primary-6 student with a 0-3 score:
 *          how many of {Reading, Writing, Math} the student is CURRENTLY meeting or
 *          exceeding (their most-recent result in each area).
 * Created: 2026-09-24
 * Region: Canada East (PIIDPA compliant)
 *
 * "Meeting+" per area:
 *   Reading  - most-recent FactAssessmentReading delta -> DimAchievementLevel code IN (3,4).
 *   Writing  - most-recent FactAssessmentWriting trait average -> band code IN (3,4)
 *              (same cut scores as tvf_StudentCohortWriting: avg >= 2.75).
 *   Math     - current-year roll-up = AVERAGE of the student's per-unit averages
 *              (unit avg = AVG(Result) over recorded tasks; blanks are absent rows, so
 *              already excluded) >= 0.75 (Meeting / In-depth).
 *
 * SCOPE: P-6 only (math is P-6; the whole score is defined P-6). EXCLUDES any student
 * with a CONFIRMED IPP (IsIPP = 1) in Reading, Writing, OR Math -- an IPP student is on an
 * individualized plan and isn't measured against these benchmarks. @UPN role gate is the
 * same OR-across-EXISTS branch as the other cohort TVFs (analyst/admin via StaffSchoolAccess;
 * teacher via FactSectionTeachers) -- NO region-wide branch.
 *
 * SECURITY: trusts @UPN; SELECT granted to the SP only. ORDER BY omitted (caller sorts).

/*******************************************************************************
 * Function: tvf_UserAssessmentWindows  (INLINE table-valued function)
 * Purpose: @UPN-parameterized equivalent of vw_UserAssessmentWindows for the
 *          web app (Phase 3b). The web app connects as the StudentDataAssessment
 *          service principal, so CURRENT_USER is the SP, not the teacher -- the
 *          caller-scoped views return nothing. This iTVF takes the signed-in
 *          user's UPN and runs the SAME role-branched logic (Teacher /
 *          SchoolAdmin+SpecialistTeacher / RegionalAnalyst), so admins/analysts
 *          get their full multi-school scope (coverage when a teacher is out).
 * Created: 2026-06-22
 * Region: Canada East (PIIDPA compliant)
 *
 * Why an inline TVF (not a proc): reads should be QUERYABLE -- the app does
 *   SELECT ... FROM dbo.tvf_UserAssessmentWindows(@UPN) [WHERE/ORDER BY ...]
 * keeping the role logic in one place in SQL while staying composable. Inline
 * TVFs are expanded into the calling query by the optimizer (view-like perf).
 * Reads = iTVFs; writes stay stored procs (they INSERT/UPDATE + audit).
 *
 * SECURITY: trusts the caller to pass a truthful @UPN. Safe only because SELECT
 * is granted to the SP alone and the web app passes an Entra-validated UPN (same
 * boundary as the @UPN write procs). Never expose with a client-supplied UPN.
 * Mirrors vw_UserAssessmentWindows (CURRENT_USER -> @UPN); keep in sync until the
 * Power App is retired. ORDER BY is intentionally omitted (the caller sorts).

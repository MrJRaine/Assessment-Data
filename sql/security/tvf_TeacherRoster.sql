/*******************************************************************************
 * Function: tvf_TeacherRoster  (INLINE table-valued function)
 * Purpose: @UPN-parameterized roster for the web app entry grid (Phase 3b).
 *          Combines vw_TeacherRoster's three role branches (Teacher /
 *          SchoolAdmin+SpecialistTeacher / RegionalAnalyst) with the per-student
 *          entry context the grid shows (existing level + delta, expected
 *          benchmark range for the window's dominant month, reading-IPP status).
 *          Returns one row per student for the given window + group.
 * Created: 2026-06-22
 * Modified: 2026-09-08 — @GroupKey now matches the stored DimStudent.GroupKey for
 *          homerooms (URL-safe, school-qualified); returns Homeroom + SchoolName
 *          so the roster page can show a friendly header.
 *          2026-09-15 — @GroupKey resolution is now lens-agnostic: a student is
 *          matched by their homeroom key OR (HS) a section key, so the oversight
 *          picker's Homeroom lens resolves an HS homeroom card instead of empty.
 *          2026-09-15b — also resolves a 'GRADE:<SchoolID>:<Grade>' key (oversight
 *          Grade lens = a whole school+grade cohort). SchoolID threaded through.
 *          2026-09-18 — @GroupKeys takes a comma-delimited LIST (combined rosters), and the three
 *          role branches were replaced by SECTION-FIRST resolution — see the block comment below.
 *          Homeroom / 'GRADE:' keys are no longer resolved here (course-scoped entry only ever
 *          sends 'SEC:'); recover from git if ever needed.
 *          2026-09-23 — MATERIALIZED membership. The ingest-stable half (which students sit in
 *          which subject-mapped section per window + their static attrs) now comes pre-joined from
 *          SectionRosterMembership, rebuilt each ingest by usp_RebuildRosterMembership. This TVF
 *          reads that table + a LIVE access predicate (FactSectionTeachers / StaffSchoolAccess),
 *          replacing the per-request DimStudent/FactEnrollment/DimSection/DimGrade/DimProgram join
 *          that measured ~2s for 20 students. The VOLATILE half below (reading results, deltas,
 *          benchmark, IPP, achievement, starting point) is unchanged and still live. Membership
 *          logic lives in usp_RebuildRosterMembership — keep the two in lockstep.
 * Region: Canada East (PIIDPA compliant)
 *
 * See tvf_UserAssessmentWindows header for the iTVF rationale + SECURITY note
 * (trusts @UPN; SELECT granted to the SP only). Role logic mirrors
 * vw_TeacherRoster; benchmark/IPP enrichment mirrors vw_BridgeTeacherRosterAll.
 * No section columns are projected, so SELECT DISTINCT collapses the PP-9
 * per-section fan-out to one row per student. ORDER BY omitted -- caller sorts.

/*******************************************************************************
 * Function: tvf_TeacherRoster  (INLINE table-valued function)
 * Purpose: @UPN-parameterized roster for the web app entry grid (Phase 3b).
 *          Combines vw_TeacherRoster's three role branches (Teacher /
 *          SchoolAdmin+SpecialistTeacher / RegionalAnalyst) with the per-student
 *          entry context the grid shows (existing level + delta, expected
 *          benchmark range for the window's dominant month, reading-IPP status).
 *          Returns one row per student for the given window + group.
 * Created: 2026-06-22
 * Region: Canada East (PIIDPA compliant)
 *
 * See tvf_UserAssessmentWindows header for the iTVF rationale + SECURITY note
 * (trusts @UPN; SELECT granted to the SP only). Role logic mirrors
 * vw_TeacherRoster; benchmark/IPP enrichment mirrors vw_BridgeTeacherRosterAll.
 * No section columns are projected, so SELECT DISTINCT collapses the PP-9
 * per-section fan-out to one row per student. ORDER BY omitted -- caller sorts.

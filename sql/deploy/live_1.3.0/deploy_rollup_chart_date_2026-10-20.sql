 * SUPPLEMENTAL DEPLOY — v1.3.0 reports charts (2026-10-20)
 * Run top-to-bottom in ONE session (dev first, then live) AFTER deploy_1.3.0.sql.
 * Adds the AssessmentDate column to the two oversight roll-up feeds so the Reports
 * "Achievement by cycle" trend chart has each student's latest-result date to bucket.
 * Idempotent (DROP+CREATE function + re-GRANT). Read-only feeds; no writes, no data change.
 *
 * Objects (both redeployed):
 *   tvf_StudentCohortReadingAll   (+ AssessmentDate)
 *   tvf_StudentCohortWritingAll   (+ AssessmentDate)
 * Region: Canada East (PIIDPA compliant)

/*******************************************************************************
 * Function: tvf_StudentCohortReadingAll  (INLINE table-valued function)
 * Purpose: READ-ONLY feed for the Reports > Reading OVERSIGHT roll-up tree (1.3.0 reports rebuild).
 *          Mirrors tvf_StudentCohortMathAll: one row per in-scope student PER READING-RESULT LANGUAGE,
 *          carrying the measure the client rolls up (School -> Grade|Homeroom, % Meeting/Exceeding) plus
 *          the language so the display can show distinct STUDENTS vs RESULTS per language (EN/FR) + overall.
 *          Counts/measure only — NO names or student numbers (privacy; the per-group student detail loads
 *          separately on expand, same pattern as Math).
 * Created: 2026-10-16
 * Region: Canada East (PIIDPA compliant)
 *
 * GRAIN — one row per (student x the language of a reading result they have this year):
 *   - a student with an EN and an FR reading result => TWO rows (ScaleSystem 'EN_Reading' / 'FR_Reading');
 *   - a student with one => ONE row; a student with NO reading result => ONE row, ScaleSystem NULL
 *     (so the tree shows them as "No data" instead of dropping them).
 *   Reading language is DERIVED from ReadingScaleID -> DimReadingScale.ScaleSystem (the reading fact has
 *   no AssessmentLanguage column — unlike writing). Dual-language reading is real: entry routes through the
 *   section's cycle instance, whose ScaleSystem the save stores (see project_assessment_language_tracks).
 *
 * MEASURE: AchievementLevelCode is the band for THIS result's ReadingDelta (same DimAchievementLevel logic
 *   as tvf_StudentCohort). NULL when the student has no result, no delta, or is a reading-IPP/unresolved
 *   student (not measured). The client computes % Meeting/Exceeding = rows with a Meeting-or-above band
 *   (code >= 3) / rows with ANY band; IPP / no-data are excluded from the % and shown in the hover.
 *
 * Scope: OVERSIGHT ONLY — Administrator / SpecialistTeacher / RegionalAnalyst, per school via
 *   StaffSchoolAccess (identical gate to tvf_StudentCohortMathAll / the cohort TVF oversight branch). A
 *   plain teacher gets no rows; teachers keep the flat per-student cohort list.
 *
 * @CycleGroupID NULL = all current-year Reading windows (lifetime-this-year latest); a cycle id restricts
 *   the latest-pick to that cycle's Reading instances. Grades included = the span of the selected Reading
 *   windows' MinGrade..MaxGrade (config-driven, not hardcoded), so a no-result student still appears if
 *   their grade is assessed for reading.
 *
 * SECURITY: trusts @UPN; SELECT granted to the SP only. ORDER BY omitted (caller sorts).

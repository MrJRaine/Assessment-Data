 * SUPPLEMENTAL DEPLOY — v1.3.0 reports (reading detail + writing roll-up), 2026-10-20

 *   tvf_StudentCohortReadingGroup  — + Expected benchmark range per language (+ its order for sorting)
 *                                    + achievement tint (cell-background colour)
 *   tvf_StudentCohortWritingAll    — + the 4 trait scores + the average (for the per-trait roll-up
 *                                    measures: % Meeting/Exceeding or Mean). (Re-run even though it was

/*******************************************************************************
 * Function: tvf_StudentCohortReadingGroup  (INLINE table-valued function)
 * Purpose: READ-ONLY per-GROUP reading detail for the Reports > Reading roll-up tree (1.3.0, Slice 1b).
 *          Loaded on demand when a Grade / Homeroom node is expanded — the individual students in that
 *          group with their LATEST reading level + achievement band PER LANGUAGE (EN/FR). One row per
 *          (student x reading-result language) + a NULL-language row for a student with no reading
 *          result (so they show as "No data"). The client pivots to one row per student (EN + FR cells).
 * Created: 2026-10-16
 * Region: Canada East (PIIDPA compliant)
 *
 * Group-scoped + @UPN-scoped: same OR-across-EXISTS gate as tvf_StudentCohortMath (oversight via
 * StaffSchoolAccess; teacher via FactSectionTeachers — kept for parity though the reading tree is
 * oversight-only). @GroupKey shapes: 'GRADE:<SchoolID>:<Grade>', 'SEC:<SectionID>', else a homeroom
 * DimStudent.GroupKey — resolved exactly like tvf_StudentCohortMath. Students restricted to the selected
 * Reading windows' grade span so the detail matches the roll-up's counts.
 *
 * SECURITY: trusts @UPN; SELECT granted to the SP only. ORDER BY omitted (caller sorts).

 * Function: tvf_TeacherGroups  (INLINE table-valued function)
 * Purpose: @UPN-parameterized choose-a-group resolution for the web app entry
 *          flow. Returns one row per (Scope, GroupType, GroupKey) for the given
 *          window, with student counts. Two SCOPES (a row can be in both):
 *            'Taught'    — the caller's OWN taught homerooms/sections, resolved
 *                          from FactSectionTeachers REGARDLESS of AccessLevel.
 *                          This is the dual-role fix: an Administrator/Specialist
 *                          who also teaches now gets their own classes back
 *                          instead of them vanishing into the school-wide dump.
 *                          Grade split: PP-9 -> homeroom, 10+ -> section.
 *            'Oversight' — for above-teacher roles only (Administrator /
 *                          SpecialistTeacher = their schools; RegionalAnalyst =
 *                          region-wide). Returns THREE lenses over the full P-RG
 *                          range: a Homeroom lens (every in-scope student -> their
 *                          homeroom), a Section lens (HS 10+ students -> their
 *                          sections), and a Grade lens (every student -> their
 *                          school+grade cohort). The web toggle switches lens
 *                          client-side.
 *          GroupKey: PP-9/homeroom -> stored DimStudent.GroupKey (URL-safe,
 *          school-qualified); sections -> 'SEC:'+SectionID; grade cohort ->
 *          'GRADE:'+SchoolID+':'+Grade (per-school, so the school filter carries it).
 * Created: 2026-06-22
 * Modified: 2026-09-08 — homeroom GroupKey = stored DimStudent.GroupKey.
 *          2026-09-15 — REDESIGN ([[project_group_display_redesign]]): teacher rule
 *          fires for all (Scope='Taught'); above-teacher gets a multi-lens
 *          'Oversight' scope over full P-RG (was a mutually-exclusive AccessLevel
 *          dispatch with a hard grade/homeroom-vs-section split). New output
 *          column: Scope. Shared by Data Entry now + Programming (Phase 2).
 *          2026-09-15b — added the Oversight Grade lens (per-school grade cohorts)
 *          + a Grades list column (grade-span filter). SchoolID threaded into
 *          OversightStudents for the grade GroupKey.
 * Region: Canada East (PIIDPA compliant)

 * See tvf_UserAssessmentWindows header for the iTVF rationale + SECURITY note

/*******************************************************************************
 * Function: tvf_TeacherRosterWriting  (INLINE table-valued function)
 * Purpose: Writing counterpart of tvf_TeacherRoster for the web app entry grid.
 *          IDENTICAL scoping (Teacher / SchoolAdmin+SpecialistTeacher /
 *          RegionalAnalyst role branches, window-date roster reconciliation,
 *          group filtering) -- only the per-student entry context differs:
 *          the MOST RECENT writing entry's four trait scores + their average +
 *          achievement band, plus Writing-IPP status. No benchmark / delta
 *          (writing has none). One row per student for the given window + group.
 * Created: 2026-06-25
 * Modified: 2026-09-08 — @GroupKey now matches the stored DimStudent.GroupKey for
 *          homerooms (URL-safe, school-qualified); returns Homeroom + SchoolName.
 *          2026-09-15 — @GroupKey resolution is now lens-agnostic: a student is
 *          matched by their homeroom key OR (HS) a section key, so the oversight
 *          picker's Homeroom lens resolves an HS homeroom card instead of empty.
 *          2026-09-15b — also resolves a 'GRADE:<SchoolID>:<Grade>' key (oversight
 *          Grade lens = a whole school+grade cohort). SchoolID threaded through.
 * Region: Canada East (PIIDPA compliant)
 *
 * Band = average mapped to a code (3.50/2.75/1.75) then joined to
 * DimAchievementLevel by code for name + colour (see tvf_StudentCohortWriting).
 * SECURITY: trusts @UPN; SELECT granted to the SP only. ORDER BY omitted.

/*******************************************************************************
 * Function: tvf_TeacherRosterMath  (INLINE table-valued function)
 * Purpose: @UPN-parameterized roster for the web-app MATH entry grid. Same
 *          three role branches as tvf_TeacherRoster (Teacher / SchoolAdmin+
 *          Specialist / RegionalAnalyst), but returns ONE ROW PER (student x
 *          applicable task): each student is joined to THEIR grade's DimMathTask
 *          set for the cycle's month, with the latest recorded result and the
 *          student's Math-IPP status. A multi-grade homeroom therefore returns
 *          each grade's own task set against its own students. The web app
 *          pivots these rows into the student x task matrix.
 * Created: 2026-09-03
 * Modified: 2026-09-08 — @GroupKey now matches the stored DimStudent.GroupKey for
 *          homerooms (URL-safe, school-qualified); returns Homeroom + SchoolName.
 *          2026-09-15b — @GroupKey resolves homeroom OR (HS) section OR a
 *          'GRADE:<SchoolID>:<Grade>' cohort key (oversight Grade lens); StudentGroups
 *          rewritten to the multi-candidate form. SchoolID threaded through.
 * Region: Canada East (PIIDPA compliant)
 *
 * Task selection: DimMathTask WHERE GradeCode = student.Grade AND AssessmentMonth
 *   = the cycle's benchmark/dominant month (same month lever reading uses) AND
 *   ActiveFlag = 1. Description is chosen by program: French Immersion -> FR text
 *   (falling back to EN until FR is seeded), else EN.
 *
 * Result: latest-by-date per (student, window, task) — FactAssessmentMath keeps a
 *   dated history (ongoing-assessment model), so the rn=1 pick shows the most
 *   recent 0/1 without fanning a task out to one row per entry.
 *
 * SECURITY: trusts @UPN; SELECT granted to the SP only (see tvf_TeacherRoster
 *   header). Role logic mirrors tvf_TeacherRoster exactly.
